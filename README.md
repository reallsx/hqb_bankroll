# Huaqiang North Bankroll
I had a dream of taking a trader interview for a quant job at 华强北. They asked me to play a so-called bankroll game while staying on a call with a trader. The goal is to make as much money as possible by placing bets.

After waking up, I thought maybe some famous trading firm would use a interactive game like the one I dreamed of to interview their trader candidates. Maybe a 华强北 version of this game could be useful for mock interviews?
